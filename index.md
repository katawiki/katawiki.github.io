# Welcome to Kata!

Kata allows programmers to write cross-platform software that runs on desktop, web, and HPC platforms from a single source. Kata is composed of a few different subprojects, which work together to provide a software ecosystem for writing, testing, and deploying software. 

You'll like Kata if:

  * You're tired of languages that require a PhD to build and distribute software
  * You're tired of terrible language design choices that require ugly code to be written
  * You're tired of fooling with dependencies, package managers, and version mismatches

## Why Kata?

It's a valid question -- why do we need another programming language? After all, there are plenty already out there. Aren't there enough already?

Kata is the answer to the next evolution of software development, unifying modern trends in software development into a single framework: 

  * Rock-solid standard library, with all the features needed for common programming tasks
    * [Poor standard libraries lead to vulnarabilities](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/)
  * Fully modular type system, with metaprogramming
    * Reduces code bloat, encourages more readable code
  * Access to different layers of abstraction
    * High level interfaces, and functional typing systems
    * Middle level library access
    * Low level, platform-specific APIs
  * Rich testing framework

Of course, many programming languages are "general purpose" already. TODO: write page comparing to other languages

## Getting Started

To get started learning and using Kata, you should check out the [tutorial and example pages (/learn)](/learn).

TODO: make these

## Philosophy of Kata

To dig further into Kata and how it works, check out the [philosophy pages (/phil)](/phil). Here's a brief overview:

Kata is and will always be [Free and Open Source Softare (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), under the [Kata Public License (KPL)](/kpl). Kata is also designed to be platform-agnostic and vendor-agnostic, and is meant to run on desktop, web, mobile, and HPC systems.

You can read more in our [/phil](/phil) pages, which covers design, implementation, and other aspects of philosophy.

> Mathematical Platonism is the metaphysical view that there are **abstract mathematical objects whose existence is independent** of us and our language, thought, and practices. 
> 
> **Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so do numbers and sets**. And just as statements about electrons and planets are made true or false by the objects with which they are concerned and these objectsâ€™ perfectly objective properties, so are statements about numbers and sets. 
>
> **Mathematical truths are therefore discovered, not invented.**

Right now, it's a 1 man show... But I'm always interested in new team members!
